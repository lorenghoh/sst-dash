# SST Dashboard

Link to the dashboard [link](https://lorenghoh.github.io/sst-dash/)

A dashboard showing the map of the global sea surface temperature (SST) measurements from NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST (OISST) version 2.1.

The OISST data is accessed and processed on a local machine. The scripts have been written so that they will run every day, but for now no further updates will be made.

This is a proof-of-concept for another project, where the data processing is done locally (and periodically) and only the resulting visualizations are published online. Currently the webpage is built with Quarto, but Plotly supports HTML export, so it can be used on any web framework.
